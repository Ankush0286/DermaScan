            <h3>Acne</h3>
            <p>Acne is a common skin condition caused by clogged hair follicles due to oil, dead skin cells, and bacteria. It often appears on the face, chest, and back, manifesting as pimples, blackheads, or cysts. While typically affecting teenagers, it can occur at any age. Effective treatments include proper skincare, topical medications, and, in severe cases, professional dermatological care.</p>

            <h3>Eczema</h3>
            <p>Eczema is a chronic skin condition causing inflammation, redness, itching, and dryness. It often appears as patches on the hands, face, or behind knees. Triggered by allergens, irritants, stress, or weather changes, it can vary in severity. Though not contagious, eczema requires moisturizers, medications, and avoiding triggers for management. Common types include atopic dermatitis and contact dermatitis.</p>

            <h3>Melanoma</h3>
            <p>Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that develops from pigment-producing cells called melanocytes. It often appears as a new mole or a change in an existing one, characterized by irregular shape, uneven color, and size. Melanoma can spread to other body parts if not treated early. Early detection and treatment are crucial for a better prognosis.</p>

            <h3>Psoriasis</h3>
            <p>Psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune skin condition causing rapid skin cell buildup, leading to thick, scaly patches called plaques. These plaques are often red, itchy, and covered with silvery scales, typically appearing on the scalp, elbows, knees, or lower back. Triggers include stress, infections, and weather changes. Treatment involves topical creams, phototherapy, and medications to manage symptoms and reduce inflammation.</p>

            <h3>Seborrheic Keratoses</h3>
            <p>Seborrheic keratoses are noncancerous skin growths that appear as brown, black, or tan spots with a waxy or wart-like texture. Common in older adults, they typically develop on the chest, back, face, or neck. The exact cause is unclear but may involve genetics and aging. Though harmless, they can be removed for cosmetic reasons or if irritated.</p>

            <h3>Tinea Ringworm Candidiasis</h3>
            <p>Tinea (Ringworm) is a contagious fungal infection causing red, itchy, ring-shaped rashes on the skin or scalp. Candidiasis, caused by Candida fungi, affects moist areas like the mouth (thrush) or genitals, leading to itching, redness, and white patches. Both thrive in warm, damp environments. Treatments include antifungal creams, oral medications, and maintaining hygiene to prevent recurrence.</p>

            <h3>Warts Molluscum</h3>
            <p>Warts are small, rough skin growths caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV), often appearing on hands, feet, or genitals. Molluscum contagiosum, caused by a poxvirus, results in smooth, dome-shaped, flesh-colored bumps. Both are contagious through direct contact or shared objects. While often harmless, they can be treated with topical solutions, cryotherapy, or minor procedures for removal.</p>
